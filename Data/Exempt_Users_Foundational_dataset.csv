Facility		Spring Hollow Reservoir / West County Reservoir
Owner		Western Virginia Water Authority; Roanoke County
Permit #		84-0404
Exp Date		1/14/1985
401 Action		none

Water Withdrawal Limits	
Corps permitted rules: 
  1) when flow in Roanoke River   0.4 MAF, flowby at least 0.4 MAF; 
  3) during June through March, when reservoir contains more than 100 days supply and natural flow in Roanoke  0.3 MAF, flowby past intake = at least natural flow; 
  5) during June through March, when reservoir contains 100 days or less supply and natural flow in Roanoke  0.2 MAF, flowby past intake = at least 0.2 MAF.

Watershed		Roanoke (Staunton) River

Location (City/County)		Roanoke County

Project Description		Construction of dam on unnamed tributary  of Roanoke River; construct reservoir to provide supply through 2040; construct water intake in Roanoke River near dam site for reserv refill and 50-mgd water intake in Roanoke River near Glenvar to divert water to plant; secondary use of recreation.

Notes		Proposed reservoir info: capacity = 3,500 mg; 10,740 acre-feet; 130 acres; upstream drainage = 0.5 sm; dam 800 ft long x 220 ft high x 120 ft base deep; propose wd rates of 5,000 to 20,000 gmp (7.2 to 28.8 mgd).  Reservoir renamed Spring Hollow in January 1987.  Withdrawal rules changed with Jan 1988 Corps permit as a result of state-interagency disagreement over habitat protection. Safe yield calculated to be 15.5 mgd in Jan 1988 with 50 mgd pumping capacity (would increase to 20.7 mgd if 100 mgd pump capacity were developed). SWCB concurred with Corps permit but no modification of existing 401 cert was processed.  Existing 401 Cert still contains the old rules.  File notes that with existing rules, max yield of project is 20-21 mgd (Feb 1988).  As of 2002, providing water to City of Roanoke from this source.
